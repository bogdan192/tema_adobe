A Sample Service
================

You need JDK 7 and Maven 3.

Once you have that in place simply run: `./run-server.sh`. This will download a Tomcat 7 instance, start it and deploy the web application. The 
API documentation will then be available at http://localhost:8080/apidocs and you can try out the APIs yourself.
